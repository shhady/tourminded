Questions about our tours?
Take a look at our FAQs or reach out to us.
When is the best time to visit the Holy Land?
The best time to visit the Holy Land depends on what you’re looking for in your trip. If you want to chill out on the beach, the summer months bring daily blue skies and fantastic beach weather – with lively beach bars and nonstop excitement in the capital, Tel Aviv. Be prepared for temperatures in the high 80º’s F and 90º’s F / 30º C up to 40º C, plus bigger crowds, and higher hotel prices if you visit in summertime.

Spring and fall bring more mild weather and smaller crowds. With daytime temperatures in the 60’sº F and 70’s° F / 15ºC to 25ºC in most of the country (but still hot around the Red Sea and Dead Sea), it’s an ideal time to explore the endless incredible sights the Holy Land has to offer

 


What are the top Christian sites in the Holy Land?

What does “Israeli licensed tour guide” mean?
In Israel, it’s a legal requirement for all tour guides to be licensed by the Ministry of Tourism. Guides must renew their license every two years and partake in one training course each year. All guides on Tourminded are fully licensed.  


What is the tipping culture in the Holy Land?
Tipping in restaurants is expected in Israel (between 10 to 15% depending on the quality of the service). 

Tipping taxi drivers is not common, nor is tipping when ordering at a cafe counter or getting information from your hotel. 


On guided tours, a tip between $3 and $5 is the minimum, but feel free to tip more if you are really happy with the guide and if the tour lasts multiple days.


Are there guides who can give a tour of Israel and Palestine?
Yes! Tourminded has guides that will show you around both Israel and Palestine. You can see the regions each guide visits on their personal guide page.


Why should I book through Tourminded?
Tourminded tours are more customizable than tours through any other operator. We are the only travel agency that matches you with a perfect-fit guide, ensuring you get exactly the trip you’re hoping for, nothing less! Explore our wide range of tours with engaging guides knowledgeable about religion, history, architecture, food, and more. Plus, you pay significantly less than you would when booking through other agencies because we don’t charge a premium.


How do you choose the guides?
We interview each guide individually to assess their qualifications, areas of expertise, and language proficiency. Additionally, a member of our team goes on their tour before we add them to Tourminded.


So, you can rest assured that your guided tour meets the highest quality standards and there are no unpleasant surprises on your visit to the Holy Land. Just kick back, relax, and let your guide show you the endless wonders there are to discover!


What type of electrical outlets are used in Israel? Should I bring an adapter?
Israel has two types of sockets: type C (two prongs) and type H (3 prongs in a triangle). If you are traveling from the U.S., you will need an adaptor and voltage converter. If you are coming from Europe, you don’t need an adaptor.
